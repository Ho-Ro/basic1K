This file lists the meaning of each
error code that 1K Tiny BASIC can produce.

Because error codes are not constant
across 1K Tiny BASIC versions, this list
needs to be updated whenever there is
a significant code cbange. It is possible
that this list will be out-of-sync with 
the source code if I do not have time to
update it, but for all releases, it will
be up to date.
