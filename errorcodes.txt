This file lists the meaning of each
error code that 1K Tiny BASIC can produce.

Because error codes are not constant
across 1K Tiny BASIC versions (the error
code number is the address after the call
to 'Error') this list needs to be updated
whenever there is a significant code
change. It is possible that this list
will be out-of-sync with the source code
if I do not have time to update it, but
for all releases it will be up to date.
