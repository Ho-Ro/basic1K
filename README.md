# basic8080
A BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080

It will soon be the 50th birthday of the
Intel 8080 microprocessor. This is the
device that started the microcomputer
revolution. I wrote an emulator for it
recently, and decided to write a BASIC
interpreter in the spirit of the early
microprocessor BASICs that were developed
in the late 1970s. In this era, memory was
expensive (in 1975 1Kb of RAM cost nearly
Â£1000 in today's money) and hobbyists could
often only afford a few KB. I want to
understand how small a BASIC interpreter
can be.
